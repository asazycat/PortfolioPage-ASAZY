                    <br/>
                     Northcoders News (NC News) is an immersive software project born out of the first 8-10 weeks of our intensive boot camp at Northcoders. Serving as a hands-on learning experience, this project allowed us to apply and reinforce the skills acquired during the initial phases of the program. The primary goal was to deepen our understanding of software development processes, collaboration, and integration with real-world projects.

                 <em>Key Features and Functionalities:</em>
                    <br/>
                        At its core, NC News comprises a robust backend and a sleek frontend seamlessly working together. Leveraging JavaScript, React, and Express, we crafted a dynamic application that utilizes API endpoints to fetch and display data. The backend serves as the powerhouse, handling requests and supplying the frontend with the necessary information. This project allowed us to gain proficiency in building API endpoints, managing data flow, and creating an interactive and user-friendly interface.

                        <br/>
                <em>How It Works:</em><br/>
                    The backend of NC News hosts a collection of API endpoints, meticulously designed to deliver specific data to the frontend. Through the collaborative efforts of JavaScript, React, and Express, we seamlessly integrated these components to create a cohesive and functional system. The project was then shared on GitHub, providing a platform for collaborative development and feedback from our dedicated Northcoder Tutors.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
  In summary, Northcoders News (NC News) is not just a project; it's a milestone in our journey, a tangible representation of our growing expertise, and a testament to the collaborative and immersive learning environment fostered at Northcoders.
